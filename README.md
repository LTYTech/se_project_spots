**Intro**

SPOTS is a simple web app designed for sharing photos in a clean, minimal layout. Built with HTML and CSS, it focuses on showcasing visual content without distractions — letting users post, browse, and connect through shared moments.

Created with Figma for design planning, VS Code for development, and DevTools for testing, SPOTS aims to blend simplicity, accessibility, and creativity into one seamless experience.

**Improvements**

- Add JavaScript for interactivity – Implement front-end logic to enhance user experience (e.g., dynamic content updates, animations, and responsive interactions).

- Make the app universal – Allow users to customize and upload their own photos, edit display names, and personalize profiles.

- Build a back-end – Develop a server-side system to handle user accounts, image uploads, and data storage securely.
